hello.
in this repo i have made a socket using python.
this socket is used to establish a TCP type connection between a client and a server,using this i have made a simple turn based(single threaded) chat app that runs in terminal.

how to run:

1. open the terminal in the files location and first run the myserver.py by "python myserver.py"
2. open another terminal in the same location and run the myclient.py by "python myclient.py"

and thats it,you can now chat through this terminals.

you can also chat on different devices by connectiong them to a same wi-fi network,and running one as a server and other as a client
